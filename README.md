## IMPORTANT: Fix for Blank GitHub Pages Site

If your GitHub Pages site is showing up blank, follow these steps to fix it:

1. **Update your homepage URL in package.json**:
   - Open `package.json`
   - Change the "homepage" field to match your GitHub Pages URL:
     ```
     "homepage": "https://your-github-username.github.io/CV1/",
     ```
   - Replace `your-github-username` with your actual GitHub username

2. **Rebuild and redeploy your site**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run deploy
   ```

3. **Configure GitHub Pages in your repository settings**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Navigate to Settings > Pages
   - Set the source to the `gh-pages` branch
   - Save the changes

The issue was caused by incorrect asset paths in the HTML files. By setting the correct homepage URL and deploying to the gh-pages branch, your site should now load properly.
